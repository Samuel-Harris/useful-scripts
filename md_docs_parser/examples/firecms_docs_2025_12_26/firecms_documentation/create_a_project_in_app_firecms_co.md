### Create a project in app.firecms.co

FireCMS Cloud requires the creation of a project in [app.firecms.co](https://app.firecms.co).

The new version relies on a backend that allows you to manage your
collections and schemas. The final users are now able to modify collections,
so we use a centralised service to store the configuration.

By doing this you will **not need to specify your Firebase project credentials**,
since the service will be able to access your project directly. You will only need
to specify the **project id**.
