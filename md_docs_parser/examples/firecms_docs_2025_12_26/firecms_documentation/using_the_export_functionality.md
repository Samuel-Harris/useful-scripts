### Using the Export Functionality

Once the plugin is integrated, you can use the export functionality directly within your collection views. The plugin
adds export actions to your collection views, allowing users to export data as JSON or CSV.

#### Example: Exporting a Collection

1. Navigate to the desired collection in your FireCMS application.
2. Click on the **Export** action in the collection actions toolbar.
3. Choose the desired export format (JSON or CSV).
4. The exported file will be downloaded to your device.
