### Using the **FireCMS PRO starter template**

The easiest way to use FireCMS with Next.js is to use the **FireCMS PRO starter template**. This template includes a Next.js project with FireCMS already configured.

You can create a new project using the **FireCMS PRO template** by running:

```bash
npx create-firecms-app
```
or

```bash
yarn create firecms-app
```

and select the **`FireCMS PRO with Next.js frontend`** template.

Then follow the instructions on the screen to create your project.

#### What you get

The code that will be generated for you is a Next.JS project split in **3 parts**:
- A **FireCMS instance** to manage your data.
- A **frontend app** that implements CRUD functionality for a products collection, as well as a blog view.
- A **common folder** with shared components.
