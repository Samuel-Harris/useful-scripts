### Migrating to FireCMS PRO

Most of the concepts are the same as in FireCMS 2.0, but there are some changes that you need to be aware of.
We recommend starting a new project with:
```bash
yarn create firecms-app --pro
```
or
```bash
npx create-firecms-app --pro
```

This will create a new project with the latest version of FireCMS PRO.
