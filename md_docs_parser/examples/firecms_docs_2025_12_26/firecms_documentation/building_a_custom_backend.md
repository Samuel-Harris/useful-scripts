## Building a custom backend

FireCMS internally uses 3 main controllers to manage the data, file storage and authentication.
These controllers are designed to be easily extended and replaced with your own implementations.

FireCMS provides default implementations for Firebase, Firestore and Firebase Authentication,
but you can replace them with your own implementations. We also provide an integration with MongoDB Atlas.
