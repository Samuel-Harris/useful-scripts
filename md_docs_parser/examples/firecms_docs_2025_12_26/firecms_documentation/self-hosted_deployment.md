## Self-Hosted Deployment

FireCMS works as a **headless CMS** on top of Firebase. It builds as a **single page application** that can be deployed 
to any static hosting provider. It does not require any server-side code. 

We recommend deploying to Firebase Hosting, as it is in the same ecosystem, and FireCMS will even
pick up the Firebase config from the environment.
