### Security Best Practices

- **Firestore Security Rules**: Always enforce security rules on your backend. Client-side permissions are for UI/UX purposes and can be bypassed.
- **Server-Side Validation**: For critical operations, validate permissions on a server.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum level of access they need.
