This document provides an overview of how to use the User Management Plugin with FireCMS to manage
users and roles.

The User Management Plugin allows you to create, edit, and delete users and roles within your FireCMS project.
It ensures that users have the appropriate permissions based on their roles and integrates this authentication
and permissions system directly into your backend. This plugin allows you to control which users can access
your application and what actions they can perform over what specific collections.

In this document, we will cover how to set up and use this plugin in your FireCMS application.
