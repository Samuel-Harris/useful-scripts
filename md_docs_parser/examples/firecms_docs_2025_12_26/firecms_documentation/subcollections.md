### Subcollections

Subcollections are collections of entities that are found under another entity. For example, you can have a collection
named "translations" under the entity "Article". You just need to use the same format as for defining your collection
using the field `subcollections`.

Subcollections are easily accessible from the side view while editing an entity.
