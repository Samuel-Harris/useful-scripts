This document describes how to use the **Collection Editor UI Plugin** with **FireCMS** to manage and configure your
Firestore collections. The Collection Editor UI Plugin provides an interface for creating, editing, and organizing
collections, with support for customizable permissions and configuration options.

Typically, collections in FireCMS are defined in code, and passed as a prop to the `NavigationController` on
initialization. The Collection Editor UI Plugin allows you to manage collections directly in the application, providing 
a more user-friendly and flexible way to organize and configure your Firestore collections.

In this document, we will cover how to set up and use this plugin in your FireCMS application.
