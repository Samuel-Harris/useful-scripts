### Local text-based search

In previous versions of FireCMS, you could add your external search engine solution
like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This is still possible, but now you can also
**search your data locally**. This means that you can search your data without
having to pay for an external service. This is great for small projects, or
when you are just getting started.

This feature is meant to be used with **small datasets**. If you have a large
dataset, you should still use an external search engine.
