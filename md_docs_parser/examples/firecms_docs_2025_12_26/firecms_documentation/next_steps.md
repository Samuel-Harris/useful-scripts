### Next steps
- Explore other customization: [Custom previews](https://firecms.co/docs/custom_previews.md)
- Reuse logic across many properties: create a shared field component and pass different `customProps`.
- Open source friendly? Consider contributing a reusable field to the community.

By leveraging custom fields you can create rich authoring experiences closely aligned with your product's domain while keeping validation, state and persistence centralized in FireCMS.
