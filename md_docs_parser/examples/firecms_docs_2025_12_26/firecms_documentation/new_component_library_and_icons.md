### New component library and Icons

We have also created a new component library that you can use to build your own components
(or use it in any project you like really!). You can get it from npm:

```bash
yarn add @firecms/ui
```
(you only need to install it if you want to use it in a different project)

The components are fully typed and documented. You can find the documentation [here](/docs/components).
They are based on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. They are easily customizable, and you can
use them to build your own components. They are also accessible and responsive.
