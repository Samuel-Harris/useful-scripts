![data_import.png](/img/data_import.png)

The **Data Import Plugin** for FireCMS enables you to import collection data from JSON, CSV, XLSL (Excel) files directly
into your
FireCMS application. This plugins provide an interface where users can upload files and map the existing data to the
collection properties. This makes it very convenient to move data from one service to another and convert data into
the right data types in the database.

The plugin is able to do automatic conversion of some data types such as dates.

The import feature can be also used within the collection editor plugin. In the collection editor, you can create
new collections from a data file. It will be able to understand your data structure correctly, and even infer
types such as as dates or enums (even if they are stored as strings).
