You can check a **demo** of this template:
- [**Admin panel**](https://next.firecms.co/cms)
- [**Frontend**](https://next.firecms.co/products)

You can change the data in the demo and see the updates, but it gets reset every **hour**.

Get a **frontend template** with sample **CRUD views** that include:
- Integration with **Firebase** and **FireCMS**. Reuse components both in frontend and admin panel.
- **Live preview**: see how the changes in the CMS will be reflected in the website, using the exact same code.
- UI implemented with **tailwindcss** and **Radix UI components**.
- Advanced **filtering options**
- Data fetch on **scrolling**.
- Storing filter state in **URL**.

This template is extremely easy to **customize** to your needs.
