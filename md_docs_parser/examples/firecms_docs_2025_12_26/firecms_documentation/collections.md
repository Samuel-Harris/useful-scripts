## Collections

In FireCMS, **collections** represent groups of entities. They map to your database collections and are used to define the
schema of your entities. Collections are the backbone of your CMS, and they are used to define the fields of your entities,
the permissions, the filters, and the actions that can be performed on them.

You can find collections at the **top level** of the navigation tree (the entries displayed in the home page and the
navigation drawer), or as **subcollections**.

Collections in FireCMS can be defined in two ways:

- Using the **Collection editor UI**.
- Using **code**.

If the logged-in user has the required permissions, they will be able to create collections using the UI. Collections
defined by the UI have some limitations, such as not being able to define any callbacks.

On the other hand, if you are using code, you can define your collections programmatically, and you can use all the
features of FireCMS., including defining custom callbacks, customizing the permissions, and defining custom fields
and components.
