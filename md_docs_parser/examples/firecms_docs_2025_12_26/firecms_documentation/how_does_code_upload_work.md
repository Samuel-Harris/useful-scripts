### How does code upload work?

We use module federation to upload your code to FireCMS Cloud.
This means that you can upload your code to FireCMS Cloud without
having to worry about the infrastructure.

When you run the command `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`, your code
will be uploaded to FireCMS Cloud and will be available in the
FireCMS Cloud instance.

Only your code will be uploaded, and it will be integrated into the core
FireCMS Cloud. This means that you can use the same authentication
system, the same collections, the same pages, etc.

This approach allows you to have a CMS that is fully customizable
while still benefiting of the continuous improvements and updates
that we provide in FireCMS Cloud.
