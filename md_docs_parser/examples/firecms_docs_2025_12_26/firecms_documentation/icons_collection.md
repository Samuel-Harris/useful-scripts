### Icons collection

You can customise the icons in different parts of the CMS, such when selecting one for
a collection. FireCMS UI now exports all the Material Icons, conveniently exported as React components.

We have also added an [icon search function](/docs/icons) in the website to find the icon you need.

It makes it easy to find the right icon key when defining configuration for your collections, or to
find the right icon component when you want to use it in your own components.
