## Cloud Quickstart


:::note
Start here if you want to customize FireCMS Cloud.
You can run a FireCMS project without writing a single line of code
from [FireCMS Cloud](https://app.firecms.co).
This guide is for developers who want to add custom code to their FireCMS project.
:::

In order to add custom code to your FireCMS Cloud project, you need:
- A **Firebase** project
- A **FireCMS Cloud** project

You can create both projects from FireCMS Cloud, or connect an existing Firebase
project to a new FireCMS Cloud project.

Once you have both projects created you can initialize your codebase by running:

```
npx create-firecms-app
```

or

```
yarn create firecms-app
```

Make sure to select the option FireCMS Cloud, and follow the instructions in the CLI.

This will create a new folder with all the code you need to get started.
In the code you will be able to add custom collections, custom pages, custom
fields, custom actions, custom properties, etc.
