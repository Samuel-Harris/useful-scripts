## Dynamic root collections

Let's build a more complex example where the main navigation is **loaded dynamically** from
the database. We will use the `units` collection as the one for generating the
rest of the navigation.

For this example we will have `Units` and `Lessons` as the main content types,
imagine we are modeling the structure for a course.

In the units collection we will create a document for each unit:

![dynamic_navigation_collection](/img/recipes/dynamic_navigation_collection.png)

And each of those documents will generate a new navigation item. In this case
we will have 3 navigation items, one for each unit:

![dynamic_navigation_home](/img/recipes/dynamic_navigation_home.png)

#### Declare the main collection

Let's define the `units` collection as the main one:

:::note
We are going to implement a couple on callbacks on entity save and delete to
update the navigation when data is changed.
That prevents the suer from refreshing the app in order to see the changes.
How cool is that?
:::

```tsx
import { buildCollection } from "@firecms/core";

export type Unit = {
    name: string;
    description: string;
}

export const unitsCollection = buildCollection<Unit>({
    name: "Units",
    singularName: "Unit",
    group: "Main",
    id: "units",
    path: "units",
    customId: true,
    icon: "LocalLibrary",
    callbacks: {
        onSaveSuccess: ({ context }) => {
            context.navigation.refreshNavigation();
        },
        onDelete: ({ context }) => {
            context.navigation.refreshNavigation();
        }
    },
    properties: {
        name: {
            name: "Name",
            validation: { required: true },
            dataType: "string"
        },
        description: {
            name: "Description",
            validation: { required: true },
            dataType: "string",
            multiline: true
        }
    }
});

```

#### Dynamic collection builder

Typically in FireCMS you pass a static list of collections to the main CMS
component, but in this case we need to build the collections dynamically based
on the data in the database.

FireCMS allows you to pass a function that returns a list of collections to the
`collections` prop of the `FireCMSApp` component.

```tsx
import { buildCollection, EntityCollectionsBuilder } from "@firecms/core";
import { Unit, unitsCollection } from "./unit_collection";

const collectionBuilder: EntityCollectionsBuilder = async ({
                                                               dataSource,
                                                               user
                                                           }) => {
    const units = await dataSource.fetchCollection<Unit>({
        path: "units",
    });
    const lessonCollections = units.map(unit => buildCollection<Unit>({
        name: unit.values.name,
        id: `units/${unit.id}/lessons`,
        path: `units/${unit.id}/lessons`,
        description: unit.values.description,
        group: "Units",
        properties: {
            name: {
                name: "Name",
                dataType: "string"
            },
            description: {
                name: "Description",
                dataType: "string"
            }
        }
    }));

    return [
        unitsCollection,
        ...lessonCollections
    ]
};

```

:::tip
Collections can be conveniently loaded asynchronously.
:::

This code is fetching the data that is being generated in the `units` collection
and creating a new collection for each of the documents.
