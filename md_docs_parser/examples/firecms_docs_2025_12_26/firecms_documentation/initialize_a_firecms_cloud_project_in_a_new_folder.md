### Initialize a FireCMS Cloud project in a new folder

It is advisable to create a new project from scratch and then migrate your collections and views to
the new folder.

In order to do so, run
```
npx create-firecms-app
```
and create a new project in a new folder.

The CLI will initialize an empty project with the new format, and all the configuration files
ready so you don't need to worry about it.
