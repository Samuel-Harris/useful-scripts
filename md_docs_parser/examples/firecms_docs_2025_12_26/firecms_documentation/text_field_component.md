## Text Field Component

Text fields are versatile UI elements that allow users to input, edit, and display text within an application.
They play a crucial role in user interaction, providing a straightforward way for users to enter data, provide
feedback, complete forms, and interact with various interfaces that require text input. Text fields can be used for
short inputs like usernames or passwords, as well as for longer text entries like comments, messages, or
detailed descriptions.

In the context of FireCMS UI, the design principles and components are loosely based on Google's Material Design guidelines. This means that
the text fields in FireCMS benefit from a consistent and user-friendly design language, ensuring a cohesive
look and feel across different web applications. By leveraging these components, developers can quickly build
interactive and visually appealing forms and input areas that enhance user experience and maintain design consistency.
