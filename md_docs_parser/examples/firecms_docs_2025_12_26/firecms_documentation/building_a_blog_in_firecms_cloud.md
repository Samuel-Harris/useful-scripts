## Building a blog in FireCMS Cloud

![blog_example](/img/blog_example.webp)

:::note
In this tutorial we assume you have set up a Firebase project and a FireCMS instance with custom code.
If you don't, check the [Quickstart](https://firecms.co/docs/cloud/quickstart) section.
:::

We don't need to explain the benefits of using a headless CMS instead of a
traditional blogging approach like WordPress, but here are a few:
- it is easier and faster to develop on, since there is no coupling between
frontend and backend.
- since your frontend is independent, you are free to change it in any way you
want, same goes for the backend.
- it is suited for omnichannel applications, you can use the same backend and
CMS with multiple apps and websites
- smaller, specialised teams
- scalability
- less costs
- flexibility and simplicity

:::tip Frontend
When you are done implementing the steps in this tutorial, you may want to check
how to build a simple **next.js** frontend app (or any other frontend framework).
We suggest next.js since it uses React, and it will make things easier.
We are already providing many of the React components you could need in
your frontend app, so you can focus on the business logic.
