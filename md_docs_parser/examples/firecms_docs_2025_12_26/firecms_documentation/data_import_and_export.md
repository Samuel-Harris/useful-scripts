### Data import and export

#### Export
You now have better control of how your data is **exported**:
- Define the format of your dates
- Define how arrays get serialized in CSV files (assign one column per array item, or
serialize the array as a string)
- Export your data as JSON or CSV.

#### Import
You can now **import data** from CSV, JSON or Excel files. This is great for migrating data
from other systems. We incorporate a modern UI that allows to define how the data is imported
and how it is mapped to your collections.
