### FireCMS Community

FireCMS Community is a free and open source version of FireCMS that you can
host yourself. This means that you have full control over your data, and you can
customize the CMS to your needs.

MIT licensed and completely free, FireCMS Community is a great option for
small projects that just need a CMS. It does not include all the bells and whistles
of FireCMS Cloud or FireCMS PRO, but it is still a powerful alternative, due to
its customizability and flexibility.

This version has all the functionality of FireCMS 2.0 but with many of the improvements
of the latest version, so it is great if you are looking to update and benefit from the
UI updates and performance improvements.
