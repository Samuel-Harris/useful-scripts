### Migrating collections to the new format

Despite the new format, FireCMS aims allow users to migrate existing apps with minimal
changes. The collections can be now stored both in the FireCMS backend or defined in
code like until now.

Also, you can have collections defined in both places, and decide if the code defined collections
can be modified by the user or not.

Please note that properties defined in code will not be editable by the user, unless you
explicitly mark them as `editable: true`.
