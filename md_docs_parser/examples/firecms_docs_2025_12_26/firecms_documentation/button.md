## Button

Buttons are interactive UI elements that allow users to trigger specific actions or events within an application.
They play a crucial role in user interfaces, providing a visual cue for user-initiated actions.
Buttons can be utilized in various contexts, including forms for submission, dialogs for confirmation,
and toolbars for quick access to functions and features. By clicking a button, users can submit data,
open new windows, execute commands, and much more, making buttons an essential component for driving user
