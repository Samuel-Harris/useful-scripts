### Nodes

Subclasses of BaseNode define nodes for execution in the graph.

Nodes, which are generally dataclasses, generally consist of:

- fields containing any parameters required/optional when calling the node
- the business logic to execute the node, in the run method
- return annotations of the run method, which are read by `pydantic-graph` to determine the outgoing edges of the node

Nodes are generic in:

- **state**, which must have the same type as the state of graphs they're included in, StateT has a default of `None`, so if you're not using state you can omit this generic parameter, see [stateful graphs](#stateful-graphs) for more information
- **deps**, which must have the same type as the deps of the graph they're included in, DepsT has a default of `None`, so if you're not using deps you can omit this generic parameter, see [dependency injection](#dependency-injection) for more information
- **graph return type** â€” this only applies if the node returns End. RunEndT has a default of Never so this generic parameter can be omitted if the node doesn't return `End`, but must be included if it does.

Here's an example of a start or intermediate node in a graph â€” it can't end the run as it doesn't return End:

intermediate_node.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class MyNode(BaseNode[MyState]):  # (1)!
    foo: int  # (2)!

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[MyState],  # (3)!
    ) -> AnotherNode:  # (4)!
        ...
        return AnotherNode()

```

1. State in this example is `MyState` (not shown), hence `BaseNode` is parameterized with `MyState`. This node can't end the run, so the `RunEndT` generic parameter is omitted and defaults to `Never`.
1. `MyNode` is a dataclass and has a single field `foo`, an `int`.
1. The `run` method takes a `GraphRunContext` parameter, again parameterized with state `MyState`.
1. The return type of the `run` method is `AnotherNode` (not shown), this is used to determine the outgoing edges of the node.

We could extend `MyNode` to optionally end the run if `foo` is divisible by 5:

intermediate_or_end_node.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class MyNode(BaseNode[MyState, None, int]):  # (1)!
    foo: int

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[MyState],
    ) -> AnotherNode | End[int]:  # (2)!
        if self.foo % 5 == 0:
            return End(self.foo)
        else:
            return AnotherNode()

```

1. We parameterize the node with the return type (`int` in this case) as well as state. Because generic parameters are positional-only, we have to include `None` as the second parameter representing deps.
1. The return type of the `run` method is now a union of `AnotherNode` and `End[int]`, this allows the node to end the run if `foo` is divisible by 5.
