Don't use a nail gun unless you need a nail gun

If Pydantic AI [agents](../agents/) are a hammer, and [multi-agent workflows](../multi-agent-applications/) are a sledgehammer, then graphs are a nail gun:

- sure, nail guns look cooler than hammers
- but nail guns take a lot more setup than hammers
- and nail guns don't make you a better builder, they make you a builder with a nail gun
- Lastly, (and at the risk of torturing this metaphor), if you're a fan of medieval tools like mallets and untyped Python, you probably won't like nail guns or our approach to graphs. (But then again, if you're not a fan of type hints in Python, you've probably already bounced off Pydantic AI to use one of the toy agent frameworks â€” good luck, and feel free to borrow my sledgehammer when you realize you need it)

In short, graphs are a powerful tool, but they're not the right tool for every job. Please consider other [multi-agent approaches](../multi-agent-applications/) before proceeding.

If you're not confident a graph-based approach is a good idea, it might be unnecessary.

Graphs and finite state machines (FSMs) are a powerful abstraction to model, execute, control and visualize complex workflows.

Alongside Pydantic AI, we've developed `pydantic-graph` â€” an async graph and state machine library for Python where nodes and edges are defined using type hints.

While this library is developed as part of Pydantic AI; it has no dependency on `pydantic-ai` and can be considered as a pure graph-based state machine library. You may find it useful whether or not you're using Pydantic AI or even building with GenAI.

`pydantic-graph` is designed for advanced users and makes heavy use of Python generics and type hints. It is not designed to be as beginner-friendly as Pydantic AI.
