### Graph

Graph â€” this is the execution graph itself, made up of a set of [node classes](#nodes) (i.e., `BaseNode` subclasses).

`Graph` is generic in:

- **state** the state type of the graph, StateT
- **deps** the deps type of the graph, DepsT
- **graph return type** the return type of the graph run, RunEndT

Here's an example of a simple graph:

graph_example.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, Graph, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class DivisibleBy5(BaseNode[None, None, int]):  # (1)!
    foo: int

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext,
    ) -> Increment | End[int]:
        if self.foo % 5 == 0:
            return End(self.foo)
        else:
            return Increment(self.foo)


@dataclass
class Increment(BaseNode):  # (2)!
    foo: int

    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext) -> DivisibleBy5:
        return DivisibleBy5(self.foo + 1)


fives_graph = Graph(nodes=[DivisibleBy5, Increment])  # (3)!
result = fives_graph.run_sync(DivisibleBy5(4))  # (4)!
print(result.output)
#> 5

```

1. The `DivisibleBy5` node is parameterized with `None` for the state param and `None` for the deps param as this graph doesn't use state or deps, and `int` as it can end the run.
1. The `Increment` node doesn't return `End`, so the `RunEndT` generic parameter is omitted, state can also be omitted as the graph doesn't use state.
1. The graph is created with a sequence of nodes.
1. The graph is run synchronously with run_sync. The initial node is `DivisibleBy5(4)`. Because the graph doesn't use external state or deps, we don't pass `state` or `deps`.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

A [mermaid diagram](#mermaid-diagrams) for this graph can be generated with the following code:

graph_example_diagram.py

```python
from graph_example import DivisibleBy5, fives_graph

fives_graph.mermaid_code(start_node=DivisibleBy5)

```

```

  DivisibleBy5 --> Increment
  DivisibleBy5 --> [*]
  Increment --> DivisibleBy5
```

In order to visualize a graph within a `jupyter-notebook`, `IPython.display` needs to be used:

jupyter_display_mermaid.py

```python
from graph_example import DivisibleBy5, fives_graph
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(fives_graph.mermaid_image(start_node=DivisibleBy5)))

```
