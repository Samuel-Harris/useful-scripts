### RequestUsage

Bases: `UsageBase`

LLM usage associated with a single request.

This is an implementation of `genai_prices.types.AbstractUsage` so it can be used to calculate the price of the request using [genai-prices](https://github.com/pydantic/genai-prices).

#### incr

```python
incr(incr_usage: RequestUsage) -> None

```

Increment the usage in place.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `incr_usage` | `RequestUsage` | The usage to increment by. | _required_ |

#### **add**

```python
__add__(other: RequestUsage) -> RequestUsage

```

Add two RequestUsages together.

This is provided so it's trivial to sum usage information from multiple parts of a response.

**WARNING:** this CANNOT be used to sum multiple requests without breaking some pricing calculations.

) -> RequestUsage

```

Extract usage information from the response data using genai-prices.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `data` | `Any` | The response data from the model API. | _required_ | | `provider` | `str` | The actual provider ID | _required_ | | `provider_url` | `str` | The provider base_url | _required_ | | `provider_fallback` | `str` | The fallback provider ID to use if the actual provider is not found in genai-prices.
