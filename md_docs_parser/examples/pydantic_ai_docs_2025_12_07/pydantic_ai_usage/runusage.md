### RunUsage

Bases: `UsageBase`

LLM usage associated with an agent run.

Responsibility for calculating request usage is on the model; Pydantic AI simply sums the usage information across requests.

```

#### requests

```python
requests: int = 0

```

Number of requests made to the LLM API.

#### tool_calls

```python
tool_calls: int = 0

```

Number of successful tool calls executed during the run.

#### input_tokens

```python
input_tokens: int = 0

```

Total number of input/prompt tokens.

#### cache_write_tokens

```python
cache_write_tokens: int = 0

```

Total number of tokens written to the cache.

#### cache_read_tokens

```python
cache_read_tokens: int = 0

```

Total number of tokens read from the cache.

#### input_audio_tokens

```python
input_audio_tokens: int = 0

```

Total number of audio input tokens.

#### cache_audio_read_tokens

```python
cache_audio_read_tokens: int = 0

Total number of audio tokens read from the cache.

#### output_tokens

```python
output_tokens: int = 0

```

Total number of output/completion tokens.

#### details

```python
details: dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)

```

Any extra details returned by the model.

#### incr

```python
incr(incr_usage: RunUsage | RequestUsage) -> None

```

Increment the usage in place.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `incr_usage` | `RunUsage | RequestUsage` | The usage to increment by. | _required_ |

```python
def incr(self, incr_usage: RunUsage | RequestUsage) -> None:
    """Increment the usage in place.

    Args:
        incr_usage: The usage to increment by.

```

#### **add**

```python
__add__(other: RunUsage | RequestUsage) -> RunUsage

```

Add two RunUsages together.

This is provided so it's trivial to sum usage information from multiple runs.

```python
def __add__(self, other: RunUsage | RequestUsage) -> RunUsage:
    """Add two RunUsages together.

    new_usage.incr(other)
