#### index

```python
index: int

```

The index of the part within the overall response parts list.

#### part

```python
part: ModelResponsePart

```

The newly started `ModelResponsePart`.

#### previous_part_kind

```python
previous_part_kind: (
    Literal[
        "text",
        "thinking",
        "tool-call",
        "builtin-tool-call",
        "builtin-tool-return",
        "file",
    ]
    | None
) = None

```

The kind of the previous part, if any.

This is useful for UI event streams to know whether to group parts of the same kind together when emitting events.

#### event_kind

```python
event_kind: Literal['part_start'] = 'part_start'

```

Event type identifier, used as a discriminator.
