```

#### url

```python
url: str = url

```

The URL of the file.

#### force_download

```python
force_download: bool = force_download

```

For OpenAI and Google APIs it:

- If True, the file is downloaded and the data is sent to the model as bytes.
- If False, the URL is sent directly to the model and no download is performed.

#### vendor_metadata

```python
vendor_metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = vendor_metadata

```

Vendor-specific metadata for the file.

Supported by:

- `GoogleModel`: `VideoUrl.vendor_metadata` is used as `video_metadata`: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video-understanding#customize-video-processing
- `OpenAIChatModel`, `OpenAIResponsesModel`: `ImageUrl.vendor_metadata['detail']` is used as `detail` setting for images

#### media_type

```python
media_type: str

```

Return the media type of the file, based on the URL or the provided `media_type`.

#### identifier

```python
identifier: str

```

The identifier of the file, such as a unique ID.

This identifier can be provided to the model in a message to allow it to refer to this file in a tool call argument, and the tool can look up the file in question by iterating over the message history and finding the matching `FileUrl`.

This identifier is only automatically passed to the model when the `FileUrl` is returned by a tool. If you're passing the `FileUrl` as a user message, it's up to you to include a separate text part with the identifier, e.g. "This is file :" preceding the `FileUrl`.

It's also included in inline-text delimiters for providers that require inlining text documents, so the model can distinguish multiple files.

#### format

```python
format: str

```

The file format.
