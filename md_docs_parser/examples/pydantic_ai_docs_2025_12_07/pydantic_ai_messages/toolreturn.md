### ToolReturn

A structured return value for tools that need to provide both a return value and custom content to the model.

This class allows tools to return complex responses that include:

- A return value for actual tool return
- Custom content (including multi-modal content) to be sent to the model as a UserPromptPart
- Optional metadata for application use
