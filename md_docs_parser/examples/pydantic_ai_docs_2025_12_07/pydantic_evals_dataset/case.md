### Case

Bases: `Generic[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]`

A single row of a Dataset.

Each case represents a single test scenario with inputs to test. A case may optionally specify a name, expected outputs to compare against, and arbitrary metadata.

Cases can also have their own specific evaluators which are run in addition to dataset-level evaluators.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_evals import Case

case = Case(
    name='Simple addition',
    inputs={'a': 1, 'b': 2},
    expected_output=3,
    metadata={'description': 'Tests basic addition'},
)

```
