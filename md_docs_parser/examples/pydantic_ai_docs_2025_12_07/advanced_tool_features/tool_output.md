## Tool Output

Tools can return anything that Pydantic can serialize to JSON, as well as audio, video, image or document content depending on the types of [multi-modal input](../input/) the model supports:

function_tool_output.py

```python
from datetime import datetime

from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, DocumentUrl, ImageUrl
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIResponsesModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


agent = Agent(model=OpenAIResponsesModel('gpt-5'))


@agent.tool_plain
def get_current_time() -> datetime:
    return datetime.now()


@agent.tool_plain
def get_user() -> User:
    return User(name='John', age=30)


@agent.tool_plain
def get_company_logo() -> ImageUrl:
    return ImageUrl(url='https://iili.io/3Hs4FMg.png')


@agent.tool_plain
def get_document() -> DocumentUrl:
    return DocumentUrl(url='https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf')


result = agent.run_sync('What time is it?')
print(result.output)
#> The current time is 10:45 PM on April 17, 2025.

result = agent.run_sync('What is the user name?')
print(result.output)
#> The user's name is John.

result = agent.run_sync('What is the company name in the logo?')
print(result.output)
#> The company name in the logo is "Pydantic."

result = agent.run_sync('What is the main content of the document?')
print(result.output)
#> The document contains just the text "Dummy PDF file."

```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

Some models (e.g. Gemini) natively support semi-structured return values, while some expect text (OpenAI) but seem to be just as good at extracting meaning from the data. If a Python object is returned and the model expects a string, the value will be serialized to JSON.
