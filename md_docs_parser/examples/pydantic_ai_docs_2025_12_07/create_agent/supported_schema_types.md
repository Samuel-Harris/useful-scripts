### Supported Schema Types

MCP elicitation supports string, number, boolean, and enum types with flat object structures only. These limitations ensure reliable cross-client compatibility. See [supported schema types](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation#supported-schema-types) for details.
