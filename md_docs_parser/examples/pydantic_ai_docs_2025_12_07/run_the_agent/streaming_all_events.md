### Streaming All Events

Like `agent.run_stream()`, agent.run() takes an optional `event_stream_handler` argument that lets you stream all events from the model's streaming response and the agent's execution of tools. Unlike `run_stream()`, it always runs the agent graph to completion even if text was received ahead of tool calls that looked like it could've been the final result.

For convenience, a agent.run_stream_events() method is also available as a wrapper around `run(event_stream_handler=...)`, which returns an async iterable of AgentStreamEvents and a AgentRunResultEvent containing the final run result.

Note

As they return raw events as they come in, the `run_stream_events()` and `run(event_stream_handler=...)` methods require you to piece together the streamed text and structured output yourself from the `PartStartEvent` and subsequent `PartDeltaEvent`s.

To get the best of both worlds, at the expense of some additional complexity, you can use agent.iter() as described in the next section, which lets you [iterate over the agent graph](#iterating-over-an-agents-graph) and [stream both events and output](#streaming-all-events-and-output) at every step.

run_events.py

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import AgentRunResultEvent

from run_stream_event_stream_handler import handle_event, output_messages, weather_agent


async def main():
    user_prompt = 'What will the weather be like in Paris on Tuesday?'

    async for event in weather_agent.run_stream_events(user_prompt):
        if isinstance(event, AgentRunResultEvent):
            output_messages.append(f'[Final Output] {event.result.output}')
        else:
            await handle_event(event)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

    print(output_messages)
    """
