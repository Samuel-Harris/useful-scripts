## Defining Dependencies

Dependencies can be any python type. While in simple cases you might be able to pass a single object as a dependency (e.g. an HTTP connection), dataclasses are generally a convenient container when your dependencies included multiple objects.

Here's an example of defining an agent that requires dependencies.

(**Note:** dependencies aren't actually used in this example, see [Accessing Dependencies](#accessing-dependencies) below)

[Learn about Gateway](../gateway) unused_dependencies.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent


@dataclass
class MyDeps:  # (1)!
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'gateway/openai:gpt-5',
    deps_type=MyDeps,  # (2)!
)


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run(
            'Tell me a joke.',
            deps=deps,  # (3)!
        )
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. Define a dataclass to hold dependencies.
1. Pass the dataclass type to the `deps_type` argument of the Agent constructor. **Note**: we're passing the type here, NOT an instance, this parameter is not actually used at runtime, it's here so we can get full type checking of the agent.
1. When running the agent, pass an instance of the dataclass to the `deps` parameter.

unused_dependencies.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent


@dataclass
class MyDeps:  # (1)!
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    deps_type=MyDeps,  # (2)!
)


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run(
            'Tell me a joke.',
            deps=deps,  # (3)!
        )
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. Define a dataclass to hold dependencies.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_
