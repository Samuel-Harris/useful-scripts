### ReducerContext

Bases: `Generic[StateT, DepsT]`

Context information passed to reducer functions during graph execution.

The reducer context provides access to the current graph state and dependencies.

Type Parameters

StateT: The type of the graph state DepsT: The type of the dependencies

#### state

```python
state: StateT

```

The state of the graph run.

#### deps

```python
deps: DepsT

```

The deps for the graph run.

#### cancel_sibling_tasks

```python
cancel_sibling_tasks()

```

Cancel all sibling tasks created from the same fork.

You can call this if you want your join to have early-stopping behavior.
