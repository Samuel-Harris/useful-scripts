## Elicitation

In MCP, [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/elicitation) allows a server to request for [structured input](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation#supported-schema-types) from the client for missing or additional context during a session.

Elicitation let models essentially say "Hold on - I need to know X before i can continue" rather than requiring everything upfront or taking a shot in the dark.
