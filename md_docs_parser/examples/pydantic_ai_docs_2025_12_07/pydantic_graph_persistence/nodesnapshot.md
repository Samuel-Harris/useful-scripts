```

#### state

```python
state: StateT

```

The state of the graph before the node is run.

#### node

```python
node: Annotated[
    BaseNode[StateT, Any, RunEndT], CustomNodeSchema()
]

```

The node to run next.

#### start_ts

```python
start_ts: datetime | None = None

```

The timestamp when the node started running, `None` until the run starts.

#### duration

```python
duration: float | None = None

```

The duration of the node run in seconds, if the node has been run.

#### status

```python
status: SnapshotStatus = 'created'

```

The status of the snapshot.

#### kind

```python
kind: Literal['node'] = 'node'

```

The kind of history step, can be used as a discriminator when deserializing history.

#### id

```python
id: str = UNSET_SNAPSHOT_ID

```

Unique ID of the snapshot.
