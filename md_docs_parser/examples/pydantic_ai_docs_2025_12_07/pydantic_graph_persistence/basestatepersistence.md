### BaseStatePersistence

Bases: `ABC`, `Generic[StateT, RunEndT]`

Abstract base class for storing the state of a graph run.

Each instance of a `BaseStatePersistence` subclass should be used for a single graph run.

#### snapshot_end

```python
snapshot_end(state: StateT, end: End[RunEndT]) -> None

Snapshot the state of a graph when the graph has ended.

This method should add an EndSnapshot to persistence.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `state` | `StateT` | The state of the graph. | _required_ | | `end` | `End[RunEndT]` | data from the end of the run. | _required_ |

#### record_run

```python
record_run(
    snapshot_id: str,

```

Record the run of the node, or error if the node is already running.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `snapshot_id` | `str` | The ID of the snapshot to record. | _required_ |

Raises:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `GraphNodeRunningError` | if the node status it not 'created' or 'pending'. | | `LookupError` | if the snapshot ID is not found in persistence. |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `AbstractAsyncContextManager[None]` | An async context manager that records the run of the node. |

In particular this should set:

- NodeSnapshot.status to `'running'` and NodeSnapshot.start_ts when the run starts.
- NodeSnapshot.status to `'success'` or `'error'` and NodeSnapshot.duration when the run finishes.

#### load_next

```python
load_next() -> NodeSnapshot[StateT, RunEndT] | None

```

Retrieve a node snapshot with status `'created`' and set its status to `'pending'`.

This is used by Graph.iter_from_persistence to get the next node to run.

Returns: The snapshot, or `None` if no snapshot with status `'created`' exists.

#### set_graph_types

```python
set_graph_types(graph: Graph[StateT, Any, RunEndT]) -> None

#### should_set_types

```python
should_set_types() -> bool

```

Whether types need to be set.

Implementations should override this method to return `True` when types have not been set if they are needed.

```python
def should_set_types(self) -> bool:
    """Whether types need to be set.

#### set_types

```python
set_types(
    state_type: type[StateT], run_end_type: type[RunEndT]

```

Set the types of the state and run end.

This can be used to create type adapters for serializing and deserializing snapshots, e.g. with build_snapshot_list_type_adapter.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `state_type` | `type[StateT]` | The state type. | _required_ | | `run_end_type` | `type[RunEndT]` | The run end type. | _required_ |
