The [Agent-User Interaction (AG-UI) Protocol](https://docs.ag-ui.com/introduction) is an open standard introduced by the [CopilotKit](https://webflow.copilotkit.ai/blog/introducing-ag-ui-the-protocol-where-agents-meet-users) team that standardises how frontend applications communicate with AI agents, with support for streaming, frontend tools, shared state, and custom events.

Note

The AG-UI integration was originally built by the team at [Rocket Science](https://www.rocketscience.gg/) and contributed in collaboration with the Pydantic AI and CopilotKit teams. Thanks Rocket Science!
