## Design

The Pydantic AI AG-UI integration supports all features of the spec:

- [Events](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events)
- [Messages](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/messages)
- [State Management](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/state)
- [Tools](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/tools)

The integration receives messages in the form of a [`RunAgentInput`](https://docs.ag-ui.com/sdk/python/core/types#runagentinput) object that describes the details of the requested agent run including message history, state, and available tools.

These are converted to Pydantic AI types and passed to the agent's run method. Events from the agent, including tool calls, are converted to AG-UI events and streamed back to the caller as Server-Sent Events (SSE).

A user request may require multiple round trips between client UI and Pydantic AI server, depending on the tools and events needed.
