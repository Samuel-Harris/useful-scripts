### judge_output_expected

```python
judge_output_expected(
    output: Any,
    expected_output: Any,
    rubric: str,
    model: Model | KnownModelName | None = None,
    model_settings: ModelSettings | None = None,
) -> GradingOutput

```

Judge the output of a model based on the expected output, output, and a rubric.

If the model is not specified, a default model is used. The default model starts as 'openai:gpt-4o', but this can be changed using the `set_default_judge_model` function.
