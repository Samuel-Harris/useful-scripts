### AbstractBuiltinTool

Bases: `ABC`

A builtin tool that can be used by an agent.

This class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.

The builtin tools are passed to the model as part of the `ModelRequestParameters`.

#### kind

```python
kind: str = 'unknown_builtin_tool'

```

Built-in tool identifier, this should be available on all built-in tools as a discriminator.

#### unique_id

```python
unique_id: str

```

A unique identifier for the builtin tool.

If multiple instances of the same builtin tool can be passed to the model, subclasses should override this property to allow them to be distinguished.
