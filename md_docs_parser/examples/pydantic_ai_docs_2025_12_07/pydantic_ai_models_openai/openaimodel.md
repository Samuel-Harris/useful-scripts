### OpenAIModel

Bases: `OpenAIChatModel`

Deprecated

`OpenAIModel` was renamed to `OpenAIChatModel` to clearly distinguish it from `OpenAIResponsesModel` which uses OpenAI's newer Responses API. Use that unless you're using an OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible API, or require a feature that the Responses API doesn't support yet like audio.

Deprecated alias for `OpenAIChatModel`.
