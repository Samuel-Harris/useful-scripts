## Beta Features

At Pydantic, we like to move quickly and innovate! To that end, minor releases may introduce beta features (indicated by a `beta` module) that are active works in progress. While in its beta phase, a feature's API and behaviors may not be stable, and it's very possible that changes made to the feature will not be backward-compatible. We aim to move beta features out of beta within a few months after initial release, once users have had a chance to provide feedback and test the feature in production.
