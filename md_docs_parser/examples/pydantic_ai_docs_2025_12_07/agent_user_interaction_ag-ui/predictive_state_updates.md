### Predictive State Updates

Demonstrates how to use the predictive state updates feature to update the state of the UI based on agent responses, including user interaction via user confirmation.

If you've [run the example](#running-the-example), you can view it at <http://localhost:3000/pydantic-ai/feature/predictive_state_updates>.

#### Story Tools

- `write_document` - AG-UI tool to write the document to a window
- `document_predict_state` - Pydantic AI tool that enables document state prediction for the `write_document` tool

This also shows how to use custom instructions based on shared state information.

#### Story Example

Starting document text

```markdown
Bruce was a good dog,
```

Agent prompt

```text
Help me complete my story about bruce the dog, is should be no longer than a sentence.

```
