### StepFunction

Bases: `Protocol[StateT, DepsT, InputT, OutputT]`

Protocol for step functions that can be executed in the graph.

Step functions are async callables that receive a step context and return a result.

Type Parameters

StateT: The type of the graph state DepsT: The type of the dependencies InputT: The type of the input data OutputT: The type of the output data

```python
class StepFunction(Protocol[StateT, DepsT, InputT, OutputT]):
    """Protocol for step functions that can be executed in the graph.

    Type Parameters:
        StateT: The type of the graph state
        DepsT: The type of the dependencies
        InputT: The type of the input data
        OutputT: The type of the output data

    def __call__(self, ctx: StepContext[StateT, DepsT, InputT]) -> Awaitable[OutputT]:
        """Execute the step function with the given context.

        Args:
            ctx: The step context containing state, dependencies, and inputs

        Returns:
            An awaitable that resolves to the step's output

```

#### **call**

```python
__call__(
    ctx: StepContext[StateT, DepsT, InputT],
) -> Awaitable[OutputT]

```

Execute the step function with the given context.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `ctx` | `StepContext[StateT, DepsT, InputT]` | The step context containing state, dependencies, and inputs | _required_ |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `Awaitable[OutputT]` | An awaitable that resolves to the step's output |
