### MCPServerHTTP

Bases: `MCPServerSSE`

Deprecated

The `MCPServerHTTP` class is deprecated, use `MCPServerSSE` instead.

An MCP server that connects over HTTP using the old SSE transport.

This class implements the SSE transport from the MCP specification. See <https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse> for more information.

Note

Using this class as an async context manager will create a new pool of HTTP connections to connect to a server which should already be running.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerHTTP

server = MCPServerHTTP('http://localhost:3001/sse')
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])

```
