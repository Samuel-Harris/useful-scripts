## Durable Execution

Prefect 3.0 brings [transactional semantics](https://www.prefect.io/blog/transactional-ml-pipelines-with-prefect-3-0) to your Python workflows, allowing you to group tasks into atomic units and define failure modes. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction can be rolled back to a clean state.

- **Flows** are the top-level entry points for your workflow. They can contain tasks and other flows.
- **Tasks** are individual units of work that can be retried, cached, and monitored independently.

Prefect 3.0's approach to transactional orchestration makes your workflows automatically **idempotent**: rerunnable without duplication or inconsistency across any environment. Every task is executed within a transaction that governs when and where the task's result record is persisted. If the task runs again under an identical context, it will not re-execute but instead load its previous result.

The diagram below shows the overall architecture of an agentic application with Prefect. Prefect uses client-side task orchestration by default, with optional server connectivity for advanced features like scheduling and monitoring.
