### Decision

Bases: `Generic[StateT, DepsT, HandledT]`

Decision node for conditional branching in graph execution.

A Decision node evaluates conditions and routes execution to different branches based on the input data type or custom matching logic.

#### id

```python
id: NodeID

```

Unique identifier for this decision node.

#### branches

```python
branches: list[DecisionBranch[Any]]

```

List of branches that can be taken from this decision.

#### note

```python
note: str | None

```

Optional documentation note for this decision.

#### branch

```python
branch(
    branch: DecisionBranch[T],
) -> Decision[StateT, DepsT, HandledT | T]

```

Add a new branch to this decision.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `branch` | `DecisionBranch[T]` | The branch to add to this decision. | _required_ |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `Decision[StateT, DepsT, HandledT | T]` | A new Decision with the additional branch. |
