## Type safe by design

Pydantic AI is designed to work well with static type checkers, like mypy and pyright.

Typing is (somewhat) optional

Pydantic AI is designed to make type checking as useful as possible for you if you choose to use it, but you don't have to use types everywhere all the time.

That said, because Pydantic AI uses Pydantic, and Pydantic uses type hints as the definition for schema and validation, some types (specifically type hints on parameters to tools, and the `output_type` arguments to Agent) are used at runtime.

We (the library developers) have messed up if type hints are confusing you more than helping you, if you find this, please create an [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues) explaining what's annoying you!

In particular, agents are generic in both the type of their dependencies and the type of the outputs they return, so you can use the type hints to ensure you're using the right types.

Consider the following script with type mistakes:

type_mistakes.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str


agent = Agent(
    'test',
    deps_type=User,  # (1)!
    output_type=bool,
)


@agent.system_prompt
def add_user_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:  # (2)!
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


def foobar(x: bytes) -> None:
    pass


result = agent.run_sync('Does their name start with "A"?', deps=User('Anne'))
foobar(result.output)  # (3)!

```

1. The agent is defined as expecting an instance of `User` as `deps`.
1. But here `add_user_name` is defined as taking a `str` as the dependency, not a `User`.
1. Since the agent is defined as returning a `bool`, this will raise a type error since `foobar` expects `bytes`.

Running `mypy` on this will give the following output:

```bash
âž¤ uv run mypy type_mistakes.py
type_mistakes.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "system_prompt" of "Agent" has incompatible type "Callable[[RunContext[str]], str]"; expected "Callable[[RunContext[User]], str]"  [arg-type]
type_mistakes.py:28: error: Argument 1 to "foobar" has incompatible type "bool"; expected "bytes"  [arg-type]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)

```

Running `pyright` would identify the same issues.
