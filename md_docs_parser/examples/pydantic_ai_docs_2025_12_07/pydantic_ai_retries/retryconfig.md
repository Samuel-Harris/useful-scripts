### RetryConfig

Bases: `TypedDict`

The configuration for tenacity-based retrying.

These are precisely the arguments to the tenacity `retry` decorator, and they are generally used internally by passing them to that decorator via `@retry(**config)` or similar.

All fields are optional, and if not provided, the default values from the `tenacity.retry` decorator will be used.
