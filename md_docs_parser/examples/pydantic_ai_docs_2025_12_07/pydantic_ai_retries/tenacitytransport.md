### TenacityTransport

Bases: `BaseTransport`

Synchronous HTTP transport with tenacity-based retry functionality.

This transport wraps another BaseTransport and adds retry capabilities using the tenacity library. It can be configured to retry requests based on various conditions such as specific exception types, response status codes, or custom validation logic.

The transport works by intercepting HTTP requests and responses, allowing the tenacity controller to determine when and how to retry failed requests. The validate_response function can be used to convert HTTP responses into exceptions that trigger retries.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `wrapped` | `BaseTransport | None` | The underlying transport to wrap and add retry functionality to. | `None` | | `config` | `RetryConfig` | The arguments to use for the tenacity retry decorator, including retry conditions, wait strategy, stop conditions, etc. See the tenacity docs for more info. | _required_ | | `validate_response` | `Callable[[Response], Any] | None` | Optional callable that takes a Response and can raise an exception to be handled by the controller if the response should trigger a retry. Common use case is to raise exceptions for certain HTTP status codes. If None, no response validation is performed. | `None` |

Example

```python
from httpx import Client, HTTPStatusError, HTTPTransport
from tenacity import retry_if_exception_type, stop_after_attempt

from pydantic_ai.retries import RetryConfig, TenacityTransport, wait_retry_after

transport = TenacityTransport(
    RetryConfig(
        retry=retry_if_exception_type(HTTPStatusError),
        wait=wait_retry_after(max_wait=300),
        stop=stop_after_attempt(5),
        reraise=True
    ),
    HTTPTransport(),
    validate_response=lambda r: r.raise_for_status()
)
client = Client(transport=transport)
