Pydantic AI is available on PyPI as [`pydantic-ai`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-ai/) so installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai

```

```bash
uv add pydantic-ai

```

(Requires Python 3.10+)

This installs the `pydantic_ai` package, core dependencies, and libraries required to use all the models included in Pydantic AI. If you want to install only those dependencies required to use a specific model, you can install the ["slim"](#slim-install) version of Pydantic AI.
