## Use with Pydantic Logfire

Pydantic AI has an excellent (but completely optional) integration with [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) to help you view and understand agent runs.

Logfire comes included with `pydantic-ai` (but not the ["slim" version](#slim-install)), so you can typically start using it immediately by following the [Logfire setup docs](../logfire/#using-logfire).
