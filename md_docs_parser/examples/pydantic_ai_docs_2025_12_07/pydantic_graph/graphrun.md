### GraphRun

Bases: `Generic[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]`

A stateful, async-iterable run of a Graph.

You typically get a `GraphRun` instance from calling `async with [my_graph.iter(...)][pydantic_graph.graph.Graph.iter] as graph_run:`. That gives you the ability to iterate through nodes as they run, either by `async for` iteration or by repeatedly calling `.next(...)`.

Here's an example of iterating over the graph from above: iter_never_42.py

```py
from copy import deepcopy
from never_42 import Increment, MyState, never_42_graph

async def main():
    state = MyState(1)
    async with never_42_graph.iter(Increment(), state=state) as graph_run:
        node_states = [(graph_run.next_node, deepcopy(graph_run.state))]
        async for node in graph_run:
            node_states.append((node, deepcopy(graph_run.state)))
        print(node_states)
        '''
        [
            (Increment(), MyState(number=1)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=1)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=2)),
            (End(data=2), MyState(number=2)),
        ]
        '''

    state = MyState(41)
    async with never_42_graph.iter(Increment(), state=state) as graph_run:
        node_states = [(graph_run.next_node, deepcopy(graph_run.state))]
        async for node in graph_run:
            node_states.append((node, deepcopy(graph_run.state)))
        print(node_states)
        '''
        [
            (Increment(), MyState(number=41)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=41)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=42)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=42)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=43)),
            (End(data=43), MyState(number=43)),
        ]
        '''

#### **init**

__init__(
    *,
    graph: Graph[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT],
    start_node: BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT],
    persistence: BaseStatePersistence[StateT, RunEndT],
    state: StateT,
    deps: DepsT,
    traceparent: str | None,
    snapshot_id: str | None = None
)

```

Create a new run for a given graph, starting at the specified node.

Typically, you'll use Graph.iter rather than calling this directly.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `graph` | `Graph[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]` | The Graph to run. | _required_ | | `start_node` | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]` | The node where execution will begin. | _required_ | | `persistence` | `BaseStatePersistence[StateT, RunEndT]` | State persistence interface. | _required_ | | `state` | `StateT` | A shared state object or primitive (like a counter, dataclass, etc.) that is available to all nodes via ctx.state. | _required_ | | `deps` | `DepsT` | Optional dependencies that each node can access via ctx.deps, e.g. database connections, configuration, or logging clients. | _required_ | | `traceparent` | `str | None` | The traceparent for the span used for the graph run. | _required_ | | `snapshot_id` | `str | None` | The ID of the snapshot the node came from. | `None` |

```

#### next_node

```python
next_node: BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | End[RunEndT]

```

The next node that will be run in the graph.

This is the next node that will be used during async iteration, or if a node is not passed to `self.next(...)`.

#### result

```python
result: GraphRunResult[StateT, RunEndT] | None

```

The final result of the graph run if the run is completed, otherwise `None`.

#### next

```python
next(
    node: BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | None = None,
) -> BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | End[RunEndT]

```

Manually drive the graph run by passing in the node you want to run next.

This lets you inspect or mutate the node before continuing execution, or skip certain nodes under dynamic conditions. The graph run should stop when you return an End node.

Here's an example of using `next` to drive the graph from above: next_never_42.py

async def main():
    state = MyState(48)

        next_node = graph_run.next_node  # start with the first node

        '''

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `node` | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | None` | The node to run next in the graph. If not specified, uses self.next_node, which is initialized to the start_node of the run and updated each time a new node is returned. | `None` |

#### **anext**

```python
__anext__() -> (
    BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | End[RunEndT]

```

Use the last returned node as the input to `Graph.next`.
