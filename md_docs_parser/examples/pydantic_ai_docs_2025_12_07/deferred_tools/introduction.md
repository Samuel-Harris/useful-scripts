There are a few scenarios where the model should be able to call a tool that should not or cannot be executed during the same agent run inside the same Python process:

- it may need to be approved by the user first
- it may depend on an upstream service, frontend, or user to provide the result
- the result could take longer to generate than it's reasonable to keep the agent process running

To support these use cases, Pydantic AI provides the concept of deferred tools, which come in two flavors documented below:

- tools that [require approval](#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval)
- tools that are [executed externally](#external-tool-execution)

When the model calls a deferred tool, the agent run will end with a DeferredToolRequests output object containing information about the deferred tool calls. Once the approvals and/or results are ready, a new agent run can then be started with the original run's [message history](../message-history/) plus a DeferredToolResults object holding results for each tool call in `DeferredToolRequests`, which will continue the original run where it left off.

Note that handling deferred tool calls requires `DeferredToolRequests` to be in the `Agent`'s [`output_type`](../output/#structured-output) so that the possible types of the agent run output are correctly inferred. If your agent can also be used in a context where no deferred tools are available and you don't want to deal with that type everywhere you use the agent, you can instead pass the `output_type` argument when you run the agent using agent.run(), agent.run_sync(), agent.run_stream(), or agent.iter(). Note that the run-time `output_type` overrides the one specified at construction time (for type inference reasons), so you'll need to include the original output type explicitly.
