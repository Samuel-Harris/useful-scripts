### OpenRouterProviderName

```python
OpenRouterProviderName = str | KnownOpenRouterProviders

```

Possible OpenRouter provider names.

Since OpenRouter is constantly updating their list of providers, we explicitly list some known providers but allow any name in the type hints. See [the OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/list-available-providers) for a full list.
