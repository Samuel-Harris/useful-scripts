### Fork

Bases: `Generic[InputT, OutputT]`

Fork node that creates parallel execution branches.

A Fork node splits the execution flow into multiple parallel branches, enabling concurrent execution of downstream nodes. It can either map a sequence across multiple branches or duplicate data to each branch.

```

#### id

```python
id: ForkID

```

Unique identifier for this fork node.

#### is_map

```python
is_map: bool

```

Determines fork behavior.

If True, InputT must be Sequence[OutputT] and each element is sent to a separate branch. If False, InputT must be OutputT and the same data is sent to all branches.

#### downstream_join_id

```python
downstream_join_id: JoinID | None

```

Optional identifier of a downstream join node that should be jumped to if mapping an empty iterable.
