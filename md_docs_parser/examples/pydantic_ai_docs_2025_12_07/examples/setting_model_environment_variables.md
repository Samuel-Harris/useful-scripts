### Setting model environment variables

These examples will need you to set up authentication with one or more of the LLMs, see the [model configuration](../../models/overview/) docs for details on how to do this.

TL;DR: in most cases you'll need to set one of the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

```

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key

```
