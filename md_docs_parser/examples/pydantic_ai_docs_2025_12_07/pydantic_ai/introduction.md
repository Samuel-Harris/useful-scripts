_GenAI Agent Framework, the Pydantic way_

Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed to help you quickly, confidently, and painlessly build production grade applications and workflows with Generative AI.

FastAPI revolutionized web development by offering an innovative and ergonomic design, built on the foundation of [Pydantic Validation](https://docs.pydantic.dev) and modern Python features like type hints.

Yet despite virtually every Python agent framework and LLM library using Pydantic Validation, when we began to use LLMs in [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire), we couldn't find anything that gave us the same feeling.

We built Pydantic AI with one simple aim: to bring that FastAPI feeling to GenAI app and agent development.
