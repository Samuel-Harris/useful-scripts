## `llms.txt`

The Pydantic AI documentation is available in the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) format. This format is defined in Markdown and suited for LLMs and AI coding assistants and agents.

Two formats are available:

- [`llms.txt`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms.txt): a file containing a brief description of the project, along with links to the different sections of the documentation. The structure of this file is described in details [here](https://llmstxt.org/#format).
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms-full.txt): Similar to the `llms.txt` file, but every link content is included. Note that this file may be too large for some LLMs.

As of today, these files are not automatically leveraged by IDEs or coding agents, but they will use it if you provide a link or the full text.
