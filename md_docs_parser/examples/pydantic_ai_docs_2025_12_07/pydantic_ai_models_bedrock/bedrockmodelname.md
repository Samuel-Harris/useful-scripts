### BedrockModelName

```python
BedrockModelName = str | LatestBedrockModelNames

```

Possible Bedrock model names.

Since Bedrock supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [the Bedrock docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html) for a full list.
