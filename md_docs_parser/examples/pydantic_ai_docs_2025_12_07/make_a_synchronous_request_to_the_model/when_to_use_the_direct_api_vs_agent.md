## When to Use the direct API vs Agent

The direct API is ideal when:

1. You need more direct control over model interactions
1. You want to implement custom behavior around model requests
1. You're building your own abstractions on top of model interactions

For most application use cases, the higher-level Agent API provides a more convenient interface with additional features such as built-in tool execution, retrying, structured output parsing, and more.
