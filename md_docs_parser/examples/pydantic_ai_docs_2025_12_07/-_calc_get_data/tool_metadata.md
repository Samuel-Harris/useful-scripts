## Tool metadata

MCP tools can include metadata that provides additional information about the tool's characteristics, which can be useful when filtering tools. The `meta`, `annotations`, and `output_schema` fields can be found on the `metadata` dict on the ToolDefinition object that's passed to filter functions.
