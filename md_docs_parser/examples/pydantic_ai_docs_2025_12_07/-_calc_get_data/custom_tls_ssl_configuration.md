## Custom TLS / SSL configuration

In some environments you need to tweak how HTTPS connections are established â€“ for example to trust an internal Certificate Authority, present a client certificate for **mTLS**, or (during local development only!) disable certificate verification altogether. All HTTP-based MCP client classes (MCPServerStreamableHTTP and MCPServerSSE) expose an `http_client` parameter that lets you pass your own pre-configured [`httpx.AsyncClient`](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/).
