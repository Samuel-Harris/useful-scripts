## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `MistralModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('mistral:mistral-large-latest')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.mistral import MistralModel

model = MistralModel('mistral-small-latest')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```
