## Running the UI

You can build multi-turn chat applications for your agent with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), a framework for building AI web applications entirely in python. Gradio comes with built-in chat components and agent support so the entire UI will be implemented in a single python file!

Here's what the UI looks like for the weather agent:

```bash
pip install gradio>=5.9.0
python/uv-run -m pydantic_ai_examples.weather_agent_gradio

```
