## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized protocol that allow AI applications (including programmatic agents like Pydantic AI, coding agents like [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and desktop applications like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) to connect to external tools and services using a common interface.

As with other protocols, the dream of MCP is that a wide range of applications can speak to each other without the need for specific integrations.

There is a great list of MCP servers at [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

Some examples of what this means:

- Pydantic AI could use a web search service implemented as an MCP server to implement a deep research agent
- Cursor could connect to the [Pydantic Logfire](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-mcp) MCP server to search logs, traces and metrics to gain context while fixing a bug
- Pydantic AI, or any other MCP client could connect to our [Run Python](https://github.com/pydantic/mcp-run-python) MCP server to run arbitrary Python code in a sandboxed environment
