## Registering via Agent Argument

As well as using the decorators, we can register tools via the `tools` argument to the Agent constructor. This is useful when you want to reuse tools, and can also give more fine-grained control over the tools.

dice_game_tool_kwarg.py

```python
import random

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, Tool

system_prompt = """\
You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number
you get back matches the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner.
Use the player's name in the response.
"""


def roll_dice() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))


def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps


agent_a = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-2.5-flash',
    deps_type=str,
    tools=[roll_dice, get_player_name],  # (1)!
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
)
agent_b = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-2.5-flash',
    deps_type=str,
    tools=[  # (2)!
        Tool(roll_dice, takes_ctx=False),
        Tool(get_player_name, takes_ctx=True),
    ],
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
)

dice_result = {}
dice_result['a'] = agent_a.run_sync('My guess is 6', deps='Yashar')
dice_result['b'] = agent_b.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')
print(dice_result['a'].output)
#> Tough luck, Yashar, you rolled a 4. Better luck next time.
print(dice_result['b'].output)
#> Congratulations Anne, you guessed correctly! You're a winner!

```

1. The simplest way to register tools via the `Agent` constructor is to pass a list of functions, the function signature is inspected to determine if the tool takes RunContext.
1. `agent_a` and `agent_b` are identical â€” but we can use Tool to reuse tool definitions and give more fine-grained control over how tools are defined, e.g. setting their name or description, or using a custom [`prepare`](../tools-advanced/#tool-prepare) method.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_
