## Usage

The protocol-specific UIAdapter subclass (i.e. AGUIAdapter or VercelAIAdapter) is responsible for transforming agent run input received from the frontend into arguments for [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../../agents/#running-agents), running the agent, and then transforming Pydantic AI events into protocol-specific events. The event stream transformation is handled by a protocol-specific UIEventStream subclass, but you typically won't use this directly.

If you're using a Starlette-based web framework like FastAPI, you can use the UIAdapter.dispatch_request() class method from an endpoint function to directly handle a request and return a streaming response of protocol-specific events. This is demonstrated in the next section.

If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `UIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods. This is demonstrated in "Advanced Usage" section below.
