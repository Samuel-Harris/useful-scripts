### StateDeps

Bases: `Generic[StateT]`

Dependency type that holds state.

This class is used to manage the state of an agent run. It allows setting the state of the agent run with a specific type of state model, which must be a subclass of `BaseModel`.

The state is set using the `state` setter by the `Adapter` when the run starts.

Implements the `StateHandler` protocol.
