### DeferredToolRequests

Tool calls that require approval or external execution.

This can be used as an agent's `output_type` and will be used as the output of the agent run if the model called any deferred tools.

Results can be passed to the next agent run using a DeferredToolResults object with the same tool call IDs.

See [deferred tools docs](../../deferred-tools/#deferred-tools) for more information.
