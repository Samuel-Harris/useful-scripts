## Pydantic Logfire

[Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) is an observability platform developed by the team who created and maintain Pydantic Validation and Pydantic AI. Logfire aims to let you understand your entire application: Gen AI, classic predictive AI, HTTP traffic, database queries and everything else a modern application needs, all using OpenTelemetry.

Pydantic Logfire is a commercial product

Logfire is a commercially supported, hosted platform with an extremely generous and perpetual [free tier](https://pydantic.dev/pricing/). You can sign up and start using Logfire in a couple of minutes. Logfire can also be self-hosted on the enterprise tier.

Pydantic AI has built-in (but optional) support for Logfire. That means if the `logfire` package is installed and configured and agent instrumentation is enabled then detailed information about agent runs is sent to Logfire. Otherwise there's virtually no overhead and nothing is sent.

Here's an example showing details of running the [Weather Agent](../examples/weather-agent/) in Logfire:

A trace is generated for the agent run, and spans are emitted for each model request and tool call.
