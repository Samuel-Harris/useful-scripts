## Using OpenTelemetry

Pydantic AI's instrumentation uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTel), which Logfire is based on.

This means you can debug and monitor Pydantic AI with any OpenTelemetry backend.

Pydantic AI follows the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), so while we think you'll have the best experience using the Logfire platform , you should be able to use any OTel service with GenAI support.
