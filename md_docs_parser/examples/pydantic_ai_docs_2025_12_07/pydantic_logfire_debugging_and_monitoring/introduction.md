Applications that use LLMs have some challenges that are well known and understood: LLMs are **slow**, **unreliable** and **expensive**.

These applications also have some challenges that most developers have encountered much less often: LLMs are **fickle** and **non-deterministic**. Subtle changes in a prompt can completely change a model's performance, and there's no `EXPLAIN` query you can run to understand why.

Warning

From a software engineers point of view, you can think of LLMs as the worst database you've ever heard of, but worse.

If LLMs weren't so bloody useful, we'd never touch them.

To build successful applications with LLMs, we need new tools to understand both model performance, and the behavior of applications that rely on them.

LLM Observability tools that just let you understand how your model is performing are useless: making API calls to an LLM is easy, it's building that into an application that's hard.
