### AnthropicJsonSchemaTransformer

Bases: `JsonSchemaTransformer`

Transforms schemas to the subset supported by Anthropic structured outputs.

Transformation is applied when:

- `NativeOutput` is used as the `output_type` of the Agent
- `strict=True` is set on the `Tool`

The behavior of this transformer differs from the OpenAI one in that it sets `Tool.strict=False` by default when not explicitly set to True.

Example

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5')

@agent.tool_plain  # -> defaults to strict=False
def my_tool(x: str) -> dict[str, int]:
    ...

```

Anthropic's SDK `transform_schema()` automatically:

- Adds `additionalProperties: false` to all objects (required by API)
- Removes unsupported constraints (minLength, pattern, etc.)
- Moves removed constraints to description field
- Removes title and $schema fields
