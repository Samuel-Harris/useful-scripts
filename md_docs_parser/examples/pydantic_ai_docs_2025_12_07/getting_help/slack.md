## Slack

Join the `#pydantic-ai` channel in the [Pydantic Slack](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/join-slack/) to ask questions, get help, and chat about Pydantic AI. There's also channels for Pydantic, Logfire, and FastUI.

If you're on a [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) Pro plan, you can also get a dedicated private slack collab channel with us.
