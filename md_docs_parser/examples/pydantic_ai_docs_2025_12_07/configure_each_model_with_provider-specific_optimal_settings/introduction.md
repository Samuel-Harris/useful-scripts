openai_model = OpenAIChatModel(
    'gpt-5',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1000)  # Higher creativity for OpenAI
)
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel(
    'claude-sonnet-4-5',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.2, max_tokens=1000)  # Lower temperature for consistency
)

fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)
agent = Agent(fallback_model)

result = agent.run_sync('Write a creative story about space exploration')
print(result.output)
"""
In the year 2157, Captain Maya Chen piloted her spacecraft through the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy. As she discovered a planet with crystalline mountains that sang in harmony with the cosmic winds, she realized that space exploration was not just about finding new worlds, but about finding new ways to understand the universe and our place within it.

```

In this example, if the OpenAI model fails, the agent will automatically fall back to the Anthropic model with its own configured settings. The `FallbackModel` itself doesn't have settings - it uses the individual settings of whichever model successfully handles the request.
