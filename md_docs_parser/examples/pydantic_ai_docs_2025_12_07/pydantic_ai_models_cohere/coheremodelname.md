### CohereModelName

```python
CohereModelName = str | LatestCohereModelNames

```

Possible Cohere model names.

Since Cohere supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [Cohere's docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models) for a list of all available models.
