### StepNode

Bases: `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, Any]`

A base node that represents a step with bound inputs.

StepNode bridges between the v1 and v2 graph execution systems by wrapping a Step with bound inputs in a BaseNode interface. It is not meant to be run directly but rather used to indicate transitions to v2-style steps.

#### step

```python
step: Step[StateT, DepsT, Any, Any]

```

The step to execute.

#### inputs

```python
inputs: Any

```

The inputs bound to this step.

#### run

```python
run(
    ctx: GraphRunContext[StateT, DepsT],
) -> BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, Any] | End[Any]

```

Attempt to run the step node.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `ctx` | `GraphRunContext[StateT, DepsT]` | The graph execution context | _required_ |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, Any] | End[Any]` | The result of step execution |

Raises:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `NotImplementedError` | Always raised as StepNode is not meant to be run directly |
