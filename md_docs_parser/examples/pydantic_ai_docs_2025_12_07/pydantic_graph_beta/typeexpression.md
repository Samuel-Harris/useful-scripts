### TypeExpression

Bases: `Generic[T]`

A workaround for type checker limitations when using complex type expressions.

```text
This class serves as a wrapper for types that cannot normally be used in positions

```

requiring `type[T]`, such as `Any`, `Union[...]`, or `Literal[...]`. It provides a way to pass these complex type expressions to functions expecting concrete types.

Example

Instead of `output_type=Union[str, int]` (which may cause type errors), use `output_type=TypeExpression[Union[str, int]]`.

Note

This is a workaround for the lack of TypeForm in the Python type system.
