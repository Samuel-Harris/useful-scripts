### Output modes

Pydantic AI implements three different methods to get a model to output structured data:

1. [Tool Output](#tool-output), where tool calls are used to produce the output.
1. [Native Output](#native-output), where the model is required to produce text content compliant with a provided JSON schema.
1. [Prompted Output](#prompted-output), where a prompt is injected into the model instructions including the desired JSON schema, and we attempt to parse the model's plain-text response as appropriate.

#### Tool Output

In the default Tool Output mode, the output JSON schema of each output type (or function) is provided to the model as the parameters schema of a special output tool. This is the default as it's supported by virtually all models and has been shown to work very well.

If you'd like to change the name of the output tool, pass a custom description to aid the model, or turn on or off strict mode, you can wrap the type(s) in the ToolOutput marker class and provide the appropriate arguments. Note that by default, the description is taken from the docstring specified on a Pydantic model or output function, so specifying it using the marker class is typically not necessary.

To dynamically modify or filter the available output tools during an agent run, you can define an agent-wide `prepare_output_tools` function that will be called ahead of each step of a run. This function should be of type ToolsPrepareFunc, which takes the RunContext and a list of ToolDefinition, and returns a new list of tool definitions (or `None` to disable all tools for that step). This is analogous to the [`prepare_tools` function](../tools-advanced/#prepare-tools) for non-output tools.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ToolOutput


class Fruit(BaseModel):
    name: str
    color: str


class Vehicle(BaseModel):
    name: str
    wheels: int


agent = Agent(
    'gateway/openai:gpt-5',
    output_type=[ # (1)!
        ToolOutput(Fruit, name='return_fruit'),
        ToolOutput(Vehicle, name='return_vehicle'),
    ],
)
result = agent.run_sync('What is a banana?')
print(repr(result.output))
#> Fruit(name='banana', color='yellow')

```

1. If we were passing just `Fruit` and `Vehicle` without custom tool names, we could have used a union: `output_type=Fruit | Vehicle`. However, as `ToolOutput` is an object rather than a type, we have to use a list.

tool_output.py

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ToolOutput


class Fruit(BaseModel):
    name: str
    color: str


class Vehicle(BaseModel):
    name: str
    wheels: int


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    output_type=[ # (1)!
        ToolOutput(Fruit, name='return_fruit'),
        ToolOutput(Vehicle, name='return_vehicle'),
    ],
)
result = agent.run_sync('What is a banana?')
print(repr(result.output))
#> Fruit(name='banana', color='yellow')

```

#### Native Output

Native Output mode uses a model's native "Structured Outputs" feature (aka "JSON Schema response format"), where the model is forced to only output text matching the provided JSON schema. Note that this is not supported by all models, and sometimes comes with restrictions. For example, Gemini cannot use tools at the same time as structured output, and attempting to do so will result in an error.

To use this mode, you can wrap the output type(s) in the NativeOutput marker class that also lets you specify a `name` and `description` if the name and docstring of the type or function are not sufficient.

[Learn about Gateway](../gateway) native_output.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, NativeOutput

from tool_output import Fruit, Vehicle

agent = Agent(
    'gateway/openai:gpt-5',
    output_type=NativeOutput(
        [Fruit, Vehicle], # (1)!
        name='Fruit_or_vehicle',
        description='Return a fruit or vehicle.'
    ),
)
result = agent.run_sync('What is a Ford Explorer?')
print(repr(result.output))
#> Vehicle(name='Ford Explorer', wheels=4)

```

1. This could also have been a union: `output_type=Fruit | Vehicle`. However, as explained in the "Type checking considerations" section above, that would've required explicitly specifying the generic parameters on the `Agent` constructor and adding `# type: ignore` to this line in order to be type checked correctly.

native_output.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, NativeOutput

from tool_output import Fruit, Vehicle

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    output_type=NativeOutput(
        [Fruit, Vehicle], # (1)!
        name='Fruit_or_vehicle',
        description='Return a fruit or vehicle.'
    ),
)
result = agent.run_sync('What is a Ford Explorer?')
print(repr(result.output))
#> Vehicle(name='Ford Explorer', wheels=4)

```

#### Prompted Output

In this mode, the model is prompted to output text matching the provided JSON schema through its [instructions](../agents/#instructions) and it's up to the model to interpret those instructions correctly. This is usable with all models, but is often the least reliable approach as the model is not forced to match the schema.

While we would generally suggest starting with tool or native output, in some cases this mode may result in higher quality outputs, and for models without native tool calling or structured output support it is the only option for producing structured outputs.

If the model API supports the "JSON Mode" feature (aka "JSON Object response format") to force the model to output valid JSON, this is enabled, but it's still up to the model to abide by the schema. Pydantic AI will validate the returned structured data and tell the model to try again if validation fails, but if the model is not intelligent enough this may not be sufficient.

To use this mode, you can wrap the output type(s) in the PromptedOutput marker class that also lets you specify a `name` and `description` if the name and docstring of the type or function are not sufficient. Additionally, it supports an `template` argument lets you specify a custom instructions template to be used instead of the default.
