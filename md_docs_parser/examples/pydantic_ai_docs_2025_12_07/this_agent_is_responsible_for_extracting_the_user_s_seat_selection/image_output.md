## Image output

Some models can generate images as part of their response, for example those that support the [Image Generation built-in tool](../builtin-tools/#image-generation-tool) and OpenAI models using the [Code Execution built-in tool](../builtin-tools/#code-execution-tool) when told to generate a chart.

To use the generated image as the output of the agent run, you can set `output_type` to BinaryImage. If no image-generating built-in tool is explicitly specified, the ImageGenerationTool will be enabled automatically.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, BinaryImage

agent = Agent('gateway/openai-responses:gpt-5', output_type=BinaryImage)

result = agent.run_sync('Generate an image of an axolotl.')
assert isinstance(result.output, BinaryImage)

```

image_output.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, BinaryImage

agent = Agent('openai-responses:gpt-5', output_type=BinaryImage)

result = agent.run_sync('Generate an image of an axolotl.')
assert isinstance(result.output, BinaryImage)

```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

If an agent does not need to always generate an image, you can use a union of `BinaryImage` and `str`. If the model generates both, the image will take precedence as output and the text will be available on ModelResponse.text:

agent = Agent('gateway/openai-responses:gpt-5', output_type=BinaryImage | str)

print(result.output)
