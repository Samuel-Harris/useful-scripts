## Design Philosophy

Code-First Approach

Pydantic Evals follows a code-first philosophy where all evaluation components are defined in Python. This differs from platforms with web-based configuration. You write and run evals in code, and can write the results to disk or view them in your terminal or in [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/evals/).

Evals are an Emerging Practice

Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science. Anyone who claims to know exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored. We've designed Pydantic Evals to be flexible and useful without being too opinionated.
