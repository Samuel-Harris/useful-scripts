## Durable Execution

DBOS workflows make your program **durable** by checkpointing its state in a database. If your program ever fails, when it restarts all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.

- **Workflows** must be deterministic and generally cannot include I/O.
- **Steps** may perform I/O (network, disk, API calls). If a step fails, it restarts from the beginning.

Every workflow input and step output is durably stored in the system database. When workflow execution fails, whether from crashes, network issues, or server restarts, DBOS leverages these checkpoints to recover workflows from their last completed step.

DBOS **queues** provide durable, database-backed alternatives to systems like Celery or BullMQ, supporting features such as concurrency limits, rate limits, timeouts, and prioritization. See the [DBOS docs](https://docs.dbos.dev/architecture) for details.

The diagram below shows the overall architecture of an agentic application in DBOS. DBOS runs fully in-process as a library. Functions remain normal Python functions but are checkpointed into a database (Postgres or SQLite).
