## Step Retries

On top of the automatic retries for request failures that DBOS will perform, Pydantic AI and various provider API clients also have their own request retry logic. Enabling these at the same time may cause the request to be retried more often than expected, with improper `Retry-After` handling.

When using DBOS, it's recommended to not use [HTTP Request Retries](../../retries/) and to turn off your provider API client's own retry logic, for example by setting `max_retries=0` on a [custom `OpenAIProvider` API client](../../models/openai/#custom-openai-client).

You can customize DBOS's retry policy using [step configuration](#step-configuration).
