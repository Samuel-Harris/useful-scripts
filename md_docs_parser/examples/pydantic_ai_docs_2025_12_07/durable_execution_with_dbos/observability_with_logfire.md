## Observability with Logfire

DBOS can be configured to generate OpenTelemetry spans for each workflow and step execution, and Pydantic AI emits spans for each agent run, model request, and tool invocation. You can send these spans to [Pydantic Logfire](../../logfire/) to get a full, end-to-end view of what's happening in your application.

For more information about DBOS logging and tracing, please see the [DBOS docs](https://docs.dbos.dev/python/tutorials/logging-and-tracing) for details.
