### Broker

Bases: `ABC`

The broker class is in charge of scheduling the tasks.

The HTTP server uses the broker to schedule tasks.

The simple implementation is the `InMemoryBroker`, which is the broker that runs the tasks in the same process as the HTTP server. That said, this class can be extended to support remote workers.

#### run_task

```python
run_task(params: TaskSendParams) -> None

```

Send a task to be executed by the worker.

async def run_task(self, params: TaskSendParams) -> None:

```

#### cancel_task

```python
cancel_task(params: TaskIdParams) -> None

```

Cancel a task.

```

#### receive_task_operations

```python
receive_task_operations() -> AsyncIterator[TaskOperation]

```

Receive task operations from the broker.

On a multi-worker setup, the broker will need to round-robin the task operations between the workers.
