#### run

```python
run() -> AsyncIterator[None]

```

Run the worker.

It connects to the broker, and it makes itself available to receive commands.

Source code in `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/fasta2a/worker.py`

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def run(self) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    """Run the worker.

    It connects to the broker, and it makes itself available to receive commands.
    """
    async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
        tg.start_soon(self._loop)
        yield
        tg.cancel_scope.cancel()

```
