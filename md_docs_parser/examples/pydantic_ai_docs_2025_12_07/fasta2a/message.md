### Message

Bases: `TypedDict`

A Message contains any content that is not an Artifact.

This can include things like agent thoughts, user context, instructions, errors, status, or metadata.

All content from a client comes in the form of a Message. Agents send Messages to communicate status or to provide instructions (whereas generated results are sent as Artifacts).

A Message can have multiple parts to denote different pieces of content. For example, a user request could include a textual description from a user and then multiple files used as context from the client.
