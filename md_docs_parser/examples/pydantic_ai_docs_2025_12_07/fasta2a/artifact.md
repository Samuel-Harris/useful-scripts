### Artifact

Bases: `TypedDict`

Agents generate Artifacts as an end result of a Task.

Artifacts are immutable, can be named, and can have multiple parts. A streaming response can append parts to existing Artifacts.

A single Task can generate many Artifacts. For example, "create a webpage" could create separate HTML and image Artifacts.
