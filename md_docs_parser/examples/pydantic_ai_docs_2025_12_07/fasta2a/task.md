### Task

Bases: `TypedDict`

A Task is a stateful entity that allows Clients and Remote Agents to achieve a specific outcome.

Clients and Remote Agents exchange Messages within a Task. Remote Agents generate results as Artifacts. A Task is always created by a Client and the status is always determined by the Remote Agent.
