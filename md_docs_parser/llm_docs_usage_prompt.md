# <library_name> documentation

The <library_name> documentation is available in a structured format at `<docs_path>`.

**Structure:**

- **Roots**: `<docs_path>/index.md` lists the main topics (directories).
- **Topic Indexes**: Inside each topic directory (e.g., `<example_directory>/`), the `index.md` serves as a Table of Contents, linking to all sub-topics.
- **Content**: Detailed documentation is in individual markdown files (e.g., `agent.md`). Introductory text is found in `introduction.md` files.

**How to use:**

1. **Explore**: Read `<docs_path>/index.md` to find the relevant high-level topic.
2. **Drill Down**: Read the `index.md` of the topic directory (e.g., `<docs_path>/<topic>/index.md`) to find specific pages.
3. **Read**: Read the specific `.md` file for the information you need.
